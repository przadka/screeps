/**
 * Hauler transports resources from containers to destination.
 * It has two states: either transporting the payload
 * or collecting the payload from containers. When spawned
 * haulers start collecting energy (not transporting).
 * Change from collecting to transporting occurs when a hauler
 * which is collecting fills itâ€™s capacity to full. Change
 * from transporting to collecting occurs if a transporting
 * huler is empty.
 * 
 * There are three variables describing hauler state:
 *  - transporting - whether it's currently transporing 
 *      collecting
 *  - assignment - containers assigned to hauler during 
 *      collecting phase (so that the hauler doesn't flick
 *      between different containers when collecting payload.)
 *  - payload - currently transported payload.
